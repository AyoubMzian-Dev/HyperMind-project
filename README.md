# Web Application for Educational Lessons and Exercises

## Project Overview
This web application is designed to help students track their lessons and practice exercises. It includes features like listing lessons, providing exercises for practice (e.g., math exercises), and allowing users to mark lessons as completed.

## Development Plan

### Step 1: Define Requirements
- List all the lessons available.
- Provide exercises for each lesson.
- Allow users to mark lessons as completed.

### Step 2: Design the Application
- Sketch the user interface (UI) for the application.
- Decide on the technology stack (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, backend technology).

### Step 3: Set Up the Development Environment
- Install necessary software and tools (e.g., code editor, web server).
- Set up a version control system (e.g., Git).

### Step 4: Develop the Application
#### 4.1 Frontend Development
- Create HTML pages for the application.
- Style the pages using CSS.
- Implement interactive elements using JavaScript.

#### 4.2 Backend Development
- Set up a server (e.g., Node.js, Flask).
- Implement functionality to manage lessons and exercises.
- Create APIs for frontend-backend communication.

### Step 5: Testing
- Test the application for usability, functionality, and bugs.
- Make necessary adjustments based on feedback.

### Step 6: Deployment
- Choose a platform for deployment (e.g., Heroku, AWS).
- Deploy the application.
- Ensure the application is running smoothly on the server.

### Step 7: Maintenance
- Regularly update the application with new lessons and exercises.
- Monitor and fix any issues that arise.

## Conclusion
This plan provides a structured approach to building the web application, ensuring all features are implemented systematically and efficiently.
